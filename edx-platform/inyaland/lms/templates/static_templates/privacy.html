		<h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>

		<p>
			At National Management Degree College, we care about the confidentiality and security of your personal information. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to keep your Personal Information secure in compliance with this Privacy Policy. "Personal Information" is defined below. As used in this Privacy Policy, "we," "us," and "our" refer to National Management Degree College.
		</p>
		<p>
			This Privacy Policy only applies to information that we collect through the National Management Degree College eLearning Platform Website (the "Site," which consists of all content and pages located within the elearning.mdl.edu.mm web domain) and does not apply to information that we may collect from you in other ways (for example, this policy does not apply to information that you may provide to us over the phone, by fax, or through conventional mail).
		</p>
		<h2><b>
			USERNAMES AND POSTINGS
		</b></h2>
		<p>
			Comments or other information posted by you to our forums, wikis or other areas of the Site designed for public communications or communications among registered class members may be viewed and downloaded by others who visit the Site. For this reason, we encourage you to use discretion when deciding whether to post any information that can be used to identify you to those forums (or other public or classwide areas).
